Itâ€™s Moving! A Probabilistic Model for Causal
Motion Segmentation in Moving Camera Videos - Pia's paper
http://sunw.csail.mit.edu/abstract/Self-Supervised_Depth_Learning.pdf - Miller's suggestion
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05067.pdf - backprop asymmetry
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.0247.pdf - random feedback

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07480.pdf - can you do this with a bilinear CNN?

[Deep Learning the Indus Script](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00523.pdf) - It can be a good backup  project for CV in case evryhting goes down. What I like about this is that it involves 2-3 areas of CV together with a DL pipeline. (Region proposal -> Segmentation -> Classification). It looks fairly approachable and a good topic to work on (--Ninad)
